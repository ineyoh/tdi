<h5 id="team-title" class="green-text text-darken-2 center">WHO ARE WE?</h5>
    <p id="team-title-content" class="center">The Innovation team took off in 2016, as part of the Product team, under the wings of François Langevin. 
            A structural shift in 2018 gave way to a broadening of its horizons, becoming the center of 
            innovation for TD Insurance as a whole.

            The strength of the team lies in the commitment and diversity of the individuals who make it up. 
            Complementary talents facilitate collaboration, the different ways of thinking stimulate creation, 
            and the thirst for development allows for the continuous challenge of the status quo.</p>

                            I interned at TD Insurance twice, first with the Pricing department and then with the Product department, before gaining a permanent position in the Pricing department 
                            in 2015 where i worked for almost 4 years and was a key member of the team for the delivery of the first phase of the GPS policy system transformation. 
                            I joined the Reinsurance department for about a year gaining additional organization and industry knowledge before starting out in my current role at the Innovation department.

                            In collaboration with key stakeholders, i am also involved in the design and delivery of meaningful MVPs to solve these problem statements with speed and agility. 
                            Ultimately, i drive result in order to achieve expected benefits and remains accountable for the success of these innovation initiatives.</p>

                            The insurance industry isn't portrayed in a good light most often and it's lacking behind many other industries in terms of innovation, 
                            so finding creative ways to solve our customer's problems is something I find very appealing and inspiring. </p>

                        <p class="mod-text">Hi I'm Debbie! I first joined TD as an intern on the Innovation team after graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Concordia University. 
                            By some divine intervention, they decided to offer me a permanent position on the team for which I am super grateful. In my past life, 
                            I also completed a Bachelor's in film studies and worked in a bunch of different settings from office jobs to movie sets. 
                            I have been with TD since mid-2019 and I can say without a doubt that this is the best job I've ever had. </p>
                        <p class="mod-head">Roles and Responsibility</p>
                        <p class="mod-text">As a junior member of the team, I'm involved in several different projects at a time in order to best develop my skills. 
                            My responsibilities include analyzing the results of our different initiatives, 
                            helping to articulate and present problem statements and the team's strategy as well as anything else that needs taking care of on the spot.
                             I also love delving into the more creative tasks that the team requires such as graphic design and copywriting.</p>
